## Project Description
Employee Skill Tracker is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage employees and their skills efficiently. The system supports creating, updating, deleting employees, and assigning different types of skills to them.

---

## Objectives
- To apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- To build a modular and scalable Java application
- To implement CRUD operations
- To practice file handling and data persistence
- To improve input validation and error handling

---

## Key Features (Requirements)

1. Add new employees  
2. View all employees  
3. Update employee information  
4. Delete employees  
5. Add skills to employees  
6. View employees with their skills  
7. Update skill level  
8. Delete skills  
9. Save data to file  
10. Load data from file

## OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation** - Private fields with getters/setters  
- **Inheritance** - 
  - `Employee` extends `Person`  
  - `TechnicalSkill` and `SoftSkill` extend `Skill`  
- **Polymorphism** - Using `List<Skill>` and overridden methods  
- **Abstraction** - Interface `Displayable`

## Data Persistence

The system uses file handling to store data in a `.txt` file.

- Save - stores all employees and skills
- Load - restores saved data
